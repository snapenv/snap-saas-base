    ----------
    __tablename__ : str
        The name of the table in the database.
    name : so.Mapped[str]
        The name of the organization. This field cannot be null.
    slug : so.Mapped[str]
        The slug of the organization. This field cannot be null and must be unique.
    bucket : so.Mapped[str]
        The bucket of the organization. This field cannot be null.
    created_by : so.Mapped[str]
        The user who created the organization. This field cannot be null and is a foreign key referencing the 'users' table.
    revoke_link : so.Mapped[bool]
        A boolean indicating whether the link to the organization has been revoked. The default value is False.
